Helix is a framework for roleplay gamemodes in [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/), based off of [NutScript 1.1](https://github.com/rebel1324/NutScript). Helix provides a stable, feature-filled, open-source, and DRM-free base so you can focus more on the things you want: making gameplay.

## Acknowledgements
Helix is a fork of NutScript 1.1 by [Chessnut](https://github.com/brianhang) and [rebel1324](https://github.com/rebel1324).
Helix was NOT MADE BY ME (OCTRASOURCE) IN ANY WAY.
