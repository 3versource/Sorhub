# Update

This is deprecated and was part of my first learning experience with Helix, Lua, and Git. I can say I learned a lot from this, so it's best to leave this behind as it severely ruins the framework of Helix and is extremely messy to work with. I will continue my work with Helix on a separate [Repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvTcd-VlM64) which is significantly more organized and reflects a much better understanding of the Helix framework, Lua, and Git.
